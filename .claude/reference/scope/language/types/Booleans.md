# Booleans

## What Is AType

A type describes what kind of value something is. It defines which values are allowed, which operations they support, and where they can be used.
The compiler uses types to check whether expressions and assignments make sense. Each expression produces a value of a particular type, which may be explicitly declared or inferred by the compiler. When a value is used where its type is not allowed, the compiler reports a type error.

## Supported Operators

- description: Logical AND operator
  symbol: &&
- description: Logical OR operator
  symbol: ||
- description: Logical negation operator
  symbol: !
- description: Equality operator.
  symbol: ==
- description: Inequality operator.
  symbol: !=

## Unsupported Operators

Any operator not explicitly listed as supported will throw a compiler error.  Before throwing an error, the compiler will follow the rules of [TypeCoercion](../variables/TypeCoercion.md#type-coercion) and [Inference](./Inference.md#inference).

## Description

Booleans are represented with lowercase `true` and `false`.
