# Piton Fluency

This document is a reference for Piton and its family: the bundled Belay
framework, project configuration, packages, plugins, tests and tools. Read it
before you read or change a Piton specbase. The GenerateFluencyPrompt skill
makes it from `spec/`. Section 19 gives the differences between the compiler
and the spec.

## 1. What Piton is

Piton is a declarative language for agent guidance. It is a "semi-natural
programming language". Indentation gives its structure. It describes skills,
agents, commands, scoped instructions and reference documents. A value can be
a paragraph of English. A value can also be a typed structure with
inheritance and composition.

The reason for Piton (`spec/scope/founding-thesis/`):

- Each language is an abstraction of the layer below it. Agentic development
  is the next layer, and the agent is the compiler.
- Humans design systems that agree with themselves. Agents write the code.
- A prompt in one session leaves no record that you can trace.
- Pure prose (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) decays. It is not clear, it repeats, and
  you cannot use it again.
- Piton adds imports, inheritance, types and references to prose. You write a
  pattern one time and use it many times.
- The author compares Piton to CAM above G-code. CNC replaced the hand of the
  machinist, not the skill. The problem below is repetition.
- The goal: an agent that reads the spec becomes a compiler for Piton and
  Belay. This repository is that test, and `crates/` is the compiler.

Core facts:

- **Piton has no runtime.** It compiles to data (JSON, YAML, Markdown) through
  **renderers**. Frameworks such as Belay add **adapters** on top of renderers.
- Piton has no functions and no loops. The ternary is the only conditional.
  All values are immutable.
- Plugins (section 13) run TypeScript only for CLI commands. They never run
  during compilation.
- **The `.pi` source is the truth.** Generated Markdown (`.claude/...`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, build output) comes from it. Edit the `.pi`
  source and build again. Do not edit the output.
- A **specbase** is a project. It has `piton.config.pi`, a source root
  (usually `spec/`), an entry file, frameworks, packages and plugins.
- A clean compile shows that guidance has a correct form. It does not show
  that an agent will do the correct thing. `piton test` (section 14) lets an
  agent judge plain English statements.

## 2. Lexical rules

- Source files end in `.pi`. A directory with an `index.pi` is a module.
- **Indentation is structure.** Use tabs or spaces, the same in all of one
  file. The canonical form is 4 spaces. `piton format` writes it, and you
  cannot change this.
- **Comments** start with `//` on their own line. Piton has no block comments.
- After code on a line, `//` is text. `url: https://x.com // note` is one
  string.
- The formatter adds a space after `//` and changes nothing more in a comment.
- To write a line that starts with `//` as text, escape it: `\ // \`.
- **Reserved words:** `anchor abstract export from import use as extends pass
  this self super true false null any simple complex string number boolean
  list dictionary`.
- A reserved word cannot be a keyword (`reserved-keyword`). It can be a key:
  `null: text` and `use: text` are correct.
- Keywords are lowercase and can use kebab-case. You define a keyword with
  `as` (8.4).
- An anchor must have a body. Write `pass` for an anchor with no properties.
  `anchor X:` alone gives `empty-anchor`.

## 3. Declarations and values

Top-level names are variables in the scope of their file. `export` lets other
files import them.

```piton
myVariable: 42
export pi: 3.14
export anchor MyAnchor:
    description: This is my anchor
```

- `key: value` must have a space after the colon.
- The value can be on the same line or indented below. The indentation is
  syntax. It is not part of the string.
- **Each property must have a value.** An empty value gives `empty-value`.
  Write `null` for "no value".
- Only an abstract anchor can declare a constraint without a value
  (`title:: string`). In other places this gives `missing-value`.

### 3.1 Types

Piton has loose types and optional type constraints.

| Type | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | Unicode. You never put quotes around it. |
| `number` | One 64-bit float type. |
| `boolean` | `true`, `false`. |
| `null` | The only "no value". `{null == null}` is `true`. |
| `list` | Ordered. Items can have different types if no constraint stops it. |
| `dictionary` | String keys. Values can have different types if no constraint stops it. |
| anchor | The only type that users define. |
| reference | The result of `@{}` (6.4). |

Simple types are string, number, boolean and null. Complex types are list,
dictionary and anchor.

Piton infers the type of a value without a constraint from its form:

| Value | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | boolean |
| `true story` | string |
| `null` | null |
| `42`, `-42` | number |
| `42 things` | string |
| `A + B` | string (no braces) |
| `This costs $5 + tax` | string |
| `"false"` | string |
| `Total: {a + b}` | string |
| `{A + B}` | the type that the operands give |
| `${...}` | string |

Each built-in type is a `type` anchor (`spec/scope/language/types/lib/Type.pi`).
It has `description`, `what-is-a-type`, `supportedOperators` and
`unsupportedOperators`. An operator that a type does not list is an error.
Piton applies this check after coercion and inference.

| Type | Operators |
| --- | --- |
| number | `+ - * / %`, `== != < <= > >=` |
| string | `+`, `++`, `== != < <= > >=` |
| boolean | `&& \|\| !`, `==`, `!=` |
| null | `==`, `!=` |
| list | `+`, `++`, `==`, `!=` |
| dictionary | `.`, `+`, `++`, `==`, `!=` |
| anchor | `.`, `==`, `!=` |
| reference | `==`, `!=` |

### 3.2 Numbers

- Correct forms: `123`, `3.14`, `0.14`, `1_200_000.00`, `-5`.
- A decimal must have its leading `0`. The compiler reads `.5` as a string.
- `_` separates digits.
- Piton has no exponent notation. The compiler reads `1e3` as a string and
  gives no error.
- `-5` is a number. `- 5` is a list item.
- Minus is never a prefix operator. `{-price}` is an error. Write
  `{0 - price}`.
- Output uses the shortest form: `1_200_000.00` → `1200000`, `0.50` → `0.5`.

### 3.3 Strings

- Strings have no quotes. **Quotes are usual characters**:
  `greeting: "Hello"` keeps the quotes.
- Only in an expression do you put quotes around string operands
  (`{"Hello" + name}`). There, the quotes are not part of the value.
- In a block of many lines, Piton joins the lines with a space.
- A blank line (or more than one) starts a new paragraph. The spec shows two
  paragraphs with a blank line between them. The compiler writes one `\n`
  (section 19).
- Markdown in a string is plain text. Piton never resolves or checks
  `[x](./x.md)` or `![x](./x.png)`. A Markdown link can never be an error.
- Only `@{}` makes links that Piton checks.

### 3.4 Escapes

- Put special text between backslashes, with a space on each side:
  `\ {1 + 2} \` → `{1 + 2}`, `\ : \` → `:`. Piton removes the spaces.
- This is the only escape. A single backslash (`\:`) is literal text.
- To escape backslashes, use more backslashes. The closing wrapper must be
  the same: `\\ \ {x} \ \\` → `\ {x} \`.
- A line that holds only backslashes opens a verbatim block. The same count
  of backslashes closes it. The spec uses `\\\`.
- A verbatim block keeps its line breaks and indentation as written.

Code fences protect nothing. Expressions, comments, list items and keys in a
fence are parsed. Put an escape block in the fence, as all spec examples do.
Tables also need an escape block, or Piton joins their rows.

````piton
description:
    ```piton
    \\\
    anchor Example:
        value: {1 + 2}
    \\\
    ```
````

An escape changes the parse. It does not change the inferred type.
`\ false \` is still a boolean. Write `${false}` for the string.

**Prose problems.** These change the structure of a block and give no error:

- A line that starts with `- ` is a list item. A line that starts with `+ ` or
  `++ ` is a composition line (5). A `:: string` property then fails. Escape
  the mark: `\ - \ item`.
- A line with the shape `word: text` is a key. Examples are `Inputs: none` and
  a wrapped line that starts with `type:`. The block becomes an implicit list.
  Escape the colon or wrap the line at a different word.
- Backticks do not protect text. `` `{x}` `` is an expression.
- An expression in text that gives a list, dictionary or anchor makes an
  implicit list (6.1).

### 3.5 Lists

```piton
a:
    - One
    - Two
b: [This, is, a, list]
nested:
    - Level 1
        - Level 2
```

`nested` is `[Level 1, [Level 2]]`.

- **Lists have no index access.** `myList[0]` does not exist. You merge and
  inherit lists. You do not calculate with them.
- A list item is never a key. `- Settings:` is the string `"Settings:"`.
- Text indented below an item becomes the *next* item. `- url` with `tag: v1`
  below it gives `["url", {"tag": "v1"}]`. You cannot address that
  dictionary.

### 3.6 Dictionaries

- Indentation makes dictionaries. `{a.b.c}` reads nested keys.
- Keys hold only Unicode letters, Unicode numbers, `_` and `-`. Keys cannot
  hold spaces or dots.
- `123`, `foo-bar`, `false` and `null` are correct keys. A key is always a
  string.
- A hyphen is part of the name: `{config.foo-bar}`. Subtraction must have
  spaces: `{a - b}`.
- If the block of a key holds only a list, that list is the value.
- If other content is above the list, the value is an implicit list. The
  list is one item of it.

### 3.7 Implicit lists

A block with prose, lists and keys together compiles to a list in source
order:

```piton
combined:
    This is a string
    - A
    - B
    nested:
        deep: text
```

The result is `["This is a string", ["A", "B"], {"nested": {"deep": "text"}}]`.
You can address keys that the block declares directly
(`{combined.nested.deep}`). You cannot address the prose or the list items.

## 4. Variables and constraints

- **In an expression, a bare name is a file-level variable or an import.**
  This is also true in an anchor. Use `this.x` or `self.x` for a property of
  the anchor.
- The constraint syntax is `name:: type: value`. A space after `::` and after
  `:` is mandatory (`constraint-spacing`).

```piton
count:: number: 42
tags:: string[]: [foo, bar]
config:: dictionary:
    a:: number: 1
x:: simple: 1
y:: complex: [1]
z:: any: 1
```

| Constraint | Accepts |
| --- | --- |
| `simple`, `complex`, `any` | The groups in 3.1. `any` accepts all values. |
| `T[]` | A list of `T`. `T` can be an anchor (`Foo[]`). |
| `Foo` (an anchor) | `Foo` or a copy of `Foo` (`f:: Foo: {Foo}`). |
| `extends Foo`, `extends Foo[]` | Any anchor with `Foo` in its chain (8.3). |

- The spec uses `extends` constraints on exported lists, for example
  `export ARITHMETIC_OPERATORS:: extends ArithmeticOperator[]: ...`.
- To name an abstract anchor as a type, import it:
  `from ./Foo import Foo`. `use` alone is not sufficient.
- Coercion rules apply only to constraints. Operators such as `+` have their
  own rules (6.3).

**More than one constraint.** Piton tries the types from left to right. The
first type that can hold the value wins.

- `a:: number:: string: 42` → `42`.
- `b:: string:: number: 42` → `"42"`.
- A literal that becomes a string keeps its text: `string: 1.0` → `"1.0"`.
- Piton calculates an expression first: `string: {1.0}` → `"1"`.
- **Piton never coerces booleans or null.** `flag:: string: false` gives
  `type-mismatch`. Write `${false}`.
- Piton never coerces collections or anchors.
- If no type matches, the result is `type-mismatch`.

**Required and optional properties** (in abstract anchors):

```piton
abstract anchor Card:
    title:: string
    subtitle:: string:: null
    footer:: string:: null: null
```

- A constraint with no value is required. If an implementer does not write
  it, the result is `unimplemented-property`.
- A required property stays required when null is permitted. You must write
  `subtitle`.
- A default value makes a property optional (`footer`). The LSP does not
  report optional properties that are not there.
- **A child cannot declare an inherited constraint again**
  (`redeclared-constraint`). It can only give a value.

## 5. Composition lines

Piton builds a block from top to bottom. **A line that starts with `+` or `++`
combines all of the block above it with the value of the line.** The line uses
that operator (6.3).

```piton
anchor Base:
    items:
        - A
        - B
anchor Child extends Base:
    items:
        + {super.items}
        - C
```

`Child.items` is `[A, B, C]`. With `- {super.items}`, it is `[[A, B], C]`.

| Operand | `+` | `++` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lists | Merge. Remove duplicates and keep the last copy. | Keep all items. |
| Dictionaries | Shallow merge. | Deep merge. |
| Strings | Join with nothing. | Join with `\n`. |

- `Child text.` and then `++ {super.d}` gives `"Child text.\nBase text."`.
- A block of only `+ {x}` is equal to `{x}`.
- To put inherited prose before new text with a space, use interpolation:
  `${super.description} and more`.

## 6. Expressions

**Piton calculates nothing outside braces.** `a + b` is text. `{a + b}` is a
calculation.

- In braces, bare words are symbols. Put quotes around strings, also in list
  literals (`{["A"] + ["B"]}`). An unknown name gives `unresolved-symbol`.
- Put the full expression in the braces. `{this.flag} && false` is text with
  one expression in it.
- An expression that is not correct is an error. The compiler also reports
  empty braces (`{}`, `${}`). Escape braces that are literal text.
- Forward references resolve.
- A loop of values that cannot resolve (`A: {B}`, `B: {A}`) gives
  `cyclic-value`.
- Piton copies collections by value.
- **Piton copies anchors, but a copy keeps its identity.** If `x: {Foo}`, then
  `{x == Foo}` is true, `${x}` is `"Foo"`, and `x` passes a `Foo` constraint.
- Write `@{Foo}` for a link. `{Foo}` gives a copy.

### 6.1 Forms and text

Each form does one job. It does the same job in all renderers.

| Form | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `{e}` | The intrinsic value. The type stays the same. An anchor serializes as its content. |
| `${e}` | A string. The output format escapes it. |
| `#{e}` | A number. Piton changes it to text only if the output format needs text. |
| `@{e}` | A reference. It renders as a link or path, never as content. |

`@{X}` points to a document. `{X}` puts a copy in place. `${X}` gives its name.

A value that is exactly one expression keeps its type. With other text around
the expression:

- `${x}` makes the full value a string.
- `{x}` with a simple value goes into the text: `Total: {a + b}` →
  `"Total: 3"`.
- `{x}` with a list, dictionary or anchor **makes the value an implicit
  list**: `See {Foo} here` → `["See", <Foo copy>, "here"]`. In Markdown, the
  content of `Foo` appears in place below its own headings.
- `@{x}` puts in a link or a path.

### 6.2 Conversions

`${}`:

- A string stays the same. Numbers and booleans become text. Null becomes
  `null`.
- An anchor becomes its source name: `${Child}` → `"Child"`.
- `${self}` becomes the name of the current most-derived anchor.
- Piton never changes the name to title case.
- A named list or dictionary becomes its name (`Anchor.prop`, or the variable
  name).
- An unnamed collection (`${[1, 2]}`) gives `no-string-form`.
- **`${}` never puts the contents in place.** Piton never parses the result as
  source again.

Example. `export anchor Metadata:` has `name: Piton` and
`version:: string: 1.0`.

| Source | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Info ${Metadata}` | `"Info Metadata"` |
| `Info {Metadata}` | `["Info", {"name": "Piton", "version": "1.0"}]` |
| `Info @{Metadata}` | `"Info ./Metadata.json:Metadata"` |
| `Info @{Metadata}` (Markdown) | `[Metadata](./Metadata.md#metadata)` |

`#{}`:

- A number stays the same.
- A string changes to a number only if the **full** string is a Piton number
  literal. `#{"42"}` → `42`. Piton never calculates the string.
- Booleans, null, collections and anchors give `not-a-number`.
- The value stays a number in structured output.

### 6.3 Operators

| Group | Operators | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access | `.` | Dictionaries and anchors. |
| Arithmetic | `+ - * / %` | Numbers only. Division or modulo by zero is an error. `%` keeps the sign of the left side: `{-7 % 3}` → `-1`. |
| Comparison | `== != < <= > >=` | `==` and `!=` work on all types. Order works on two numbers or on two strings (by code point). A mix is an error. |
| Logical | `&& \|\| !` | Booleans only. **No truthiness** (`invalid-operand`). **No short circuit**: Piton calculates both sides. `{true \|\| 5}` and `{false && 1 / 0 == 1}` are errors. A short circuit can only hide errors. |
| Conditional | `c ? a : b` | The condition must be a boolean (`invalid-condition`). Piton calculates only the selected branch. Chains are permitted on both sides. |
| Merge | `+`, `++` | See below. |

`+` selects its operation from the operand types:

| Operands | Result |
| --- | --- |
| number + number | Addition. |
| string and a simple value | Concatenation. The `${}` rules make the text: `{2 + "Hello"}` → `"2Hello"`. |
| string and a list, dictionary or anchor (either side) | An implicit list. Piton never makes a string: `{"Tags: " + tags}` → `["Tags: ", [...]]`. |
| list + list | Merge. Remove duplicates, keep the last copy: `{["A","B","C","D"] + ["A","B","C"]}` → `[D, A, B, C]`. |
| dictionary + dictionary | Shallow merge. The right side wins. |
| other | Error. `{1 + true}`, `{null + 1}` and `{1 ++ 2}` give `invalid-operand`. |

`++`:

- Lists: concatenation with duplicates (`[A, B, C, D, A, B, C]`).
- Dictionaries: deep merge. Piton merges nested dictionaries. In other cases
  the right side wins.
- Strings: join with `\n`.
- `+` is like a set. `++` is like a list.

Equality:

- Piton compares collections by structure.
- Two anchors are equal only if they are the same anchor.
- Two references are equal if they point to the same thing.

Precedence, from high to low: `.` › `!` › `* / %` › `+ - ++` ›
`< <= > >=` › `== !=` › `&&` › `||` › `? :`.
All operators group from the left. The ternary groups from the right.
Parentheses change the order. Examples: `{1 + 2 == 3 && !false}`,
`{a ? b : c ? d : e}`.

The spec documents `:` and `::` as declaration operators
(`spec/scope/language/operators/declaration/`). They are not expression
operators. No type lists them, and the precedence table does not hold them.

### 6.4 References `@{}`

- A reference must name an anchor or **a property of an anchor**
  (`@{Button}`, `@{Button.color}`). Other targets give `invalid-reference`.
- You cannot refer to a top-level list or dictionary. Put it in an anchor.
- The target, or the anchor that owns the property, goes into the dependency
  graph. The build writes it.
- Piton resolves a reference for each output target. If a target cannot show
  it, the result is an error.
- A reference never becomes a copy or a name.
- You can compare references with `==` and `!=`.
- A renderer or a framework can check references.

| Renderer | `Button` | `Button.color` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSON | `"./Button.json:Button"` | `"./Button.json:Button.color"` |
| YAML | `./Button.yaml:Button` | `./Button.yaml:Button.color` |
| Markdown | `[Button](./Button.md#button)` | `[Button.color](./Button.md#color)` |

- A Markdown link is relative to the file that holds the reference.
- It links to the specific anchor when many anchors share one output file.
- **Markdown links are lazy.** Piton does not put the content in place. An
  agent opens a link only when it needs it.

## 7. Modules

```piton
from ./FirstFile import pi, MyAnchor
from ./FirstFile import pi SliceOf, MyAnchor Alias
from /subdir/file import AnAnchor
from .. import Something
from my-package import MyAnchor
from @piton/belay import ClaudeCodeAdapter
from ./file import
    First,
    Second
```

- A path is relative to its file.
- A path that starts with `/` is relative to the config `root`. This works
  only in a project with a `piton.config.pi`.
- `.pi` is optional. The formatter removes it.
- A directory, `.` or `..` means the `index.pi` of that directory.
- You can import only exports. Other names give `unresolved-export`. A module
  that is not there gives `unresolved-module`.
- An alias has the form `Name Alias`. Piton has no `as` in imports. Only the
  alias is in scope.

Exports:

- `export Name` exports again a name that the file declares or imports.
- In an index, the short forms are `from ./X export X`, `from ./X export *`
  and `from ./X export A AliasA, B`.
- **An import into an index does not export the name again.**
- **A module exports each name one time** (`duplicate-export`). This applies
  to a name written out and to a name from `export *`, if the two names mean
  different things.
- The same anchor through two routes is not an error.
- The error names the two sources. Fix it with an alias or an explicit list.
  The LSP shows the same error.
- The compiler keeps one export. The order is: the exported declaration, then
  named exports in order, then `*` exports in order.
- If nothing else reaches the dropped item, `piton reach` reports it as
  unreachable.

Circular imports:

- **Circular imports are permitted.**
- Only values that cannot resolve (`A: {B}`, `B: {A}`) and an anchor that
  extends itself are errors.
- Two anchors that describe each other with `${}` are correct.

`use`:

- **`use` brings only user-defined keywords into scope.** Examples:
  `use ./Keywords`, `use .`, `use my-package`, `use my-package/X`,
  `use @piton/belay`.
- `import` never brings keywords. A keyword without its `use` gives
  `unknown-keyword`.
- To declare with a keyword and also name its abstract as a type, write both
  `use` and `import`.

Bundled packages: `@piton/config`, `@piton/belay`, `@piton/packaging`,
`@piton/plugin`, and one package for each bundled plugin (`@piton/test`).

The formatter sorts and breaks import and export lines:

- In each group of import lines, `use` lines come first, then `from` lines.
- It sorts lines by path and sorts the names.
- A blank line separates groups.
- It breaks a line across lines if it has more than 2 items or more than 80
  columns.

## 8. Anchors

An anchor is a named declaration. It has a part in inheritance, types,
exports and composition. It is like a class that you never make an instance
of. It compiles to an object of its resolved properties. Its keys follow the
dictionary rules.

### 8.1 Inheritance

- `anchor C extends A, B:` copies the properties of each base, then the
  properties of the child.
- **The base at the right wins. The child wins against all bases.**
- Constraints follow the same rule.
- Inheritance is structural. It is not polymorphic.
- Errors: `inheritance-cycle` (an anchor that extends itself, directly or
  not directly), `invalid-base` (not an anchor), `unresolved-base`.

### 8.2 `super`, `self`, `this`

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `super` | The merged inheritance (the last base wins). It finds a property on an earlier base if the last base does not have it. If no base has it, the result is an error. |
| `self` | The most-derived anchor. It moves down: `${self.name}` in a base shows the name of the child when Piton compiles the child. |
| `this` | The anchor that holds the text. `${this.name}` in a base always shows the value of the base. In an override, `this` is the child. |

```piton
anchor Base:
    name: Base
    a: ${this.name}
anchor Mid extends Base:
    name: Mid
    a: over ${this.name}
    b: ${self.name}
anchor Final extends Mid:
    name: Final
```

`Final` → `{"name": "Final", "a": "over Mid", "b": "Final"}`.

- `self` moves only through inheritance. When you read `${Other.note}`, Piton
  calculates it with `self` = `Other`.
- `this` and `self` always mean an anchor. This is also true in a nested
  dictionary.
- The compiler reports `this`, `self` or `super` outside an anchor:
  `invalid-this`, `invalid-self`, `invalid-super`.

### 8.3 Abstract anchors

```piton
abstract anchor Construct:
    description:: string
abstract anchor Skill extends Construct as skill:
    useWhen:: string
skill Review:
    description: Reviews code
    useWhen: Asked for a review
```

- Piton never compiles or writes an abstract anchor.
- A concrete implementer must give all required properties of the full
  abstract chain.
- An abstract that has no implementer and no export gives a warning
  (`unimplemented-abstract`).
- An anchor can implement many abstracts. It can also extend concrete
  anchors. Many abstracts can share a base.
- If two abstracts put constraints on one property that cannot agree (string
  and number), the result is `conflicting-abstracts`. Constraints that
  overlap resolve with "the right side wins".
- Constraints from concrete bases follow usual inheritance. The right side
  wins and there is no error.
- Export abstracts with a keyword. The anchor of the keyword goes last and
  wins.
- Type constraints:
  - `A[]` matches only anchors that implement `A` **directly**. With many
    abstracts, Piton uses the abstract that wins: the abstract of the
    keyword, else the abstract at the right.
  - `extends A[]` matches each concrete anchor with `A` in its chain.
- Piton keeps properties that are not in the shape of the abstract. Belay
  writes them.

### 8.4 Keywords

```piton
anchor MyAnchor as my-anchor:
    description: Mine
my-anchor Child extends Other:
    description: ${super.description} more
```

- `my-anchor Child:` is equal to `anchor Child extends MyAnchor:`.
- `my-anchor Child extends Other:` is equal to `extends Other, MyAnchor`.
  **The anchor of the keyword is last and wins.**
- An anchor has one keyword only.
- You can build keywords on keywords:
  `export abstract operator ArithmeticOperator as arithmetic-operator:`.
- The file must `use` the module that exports the keyword.

## 9. Compilation

- **`piton compile <file>`** gives one object with one key for each export.
  It does not show names without an export, or abstracts. Spec JSON examples
  do not show this wrapper.
- **`piton build`** compiles all exports of the entry and all items that
  they refer to. It compiles nothing more. It compiles exports that nothing
  uses. It never compiles abstracts.
- Renderers: `json` (default), `yaml`, `markdown`. Belay adapters build on
  the Markdown renderer.

**Markdown serialization** (`spec/scope/belay/Compilation.pi`):

- Anchor names and property names become title headings:
  `myProperty` → `My Property`. Piton does not split a run of capitals:
  `whatIsAType` → `What Is AType`.
- `${MyAnchor}` gives the source name as written. Piton does not change it to
  title case.
- The depth of a heading follows the nesting. Below level 6, Piton writes
  bold labels. Sibling keys get the same heading level.
- **Each anchor property gets a heading**, also `false` or `42`.
- A **pure dictionary** has only simple values or pure dictionaries. It has
  no lists and no mixed content at any depth.
- Piton writes a pure dictionary as it is, in a code fence. Its keys are not
  headings. This is also true when it is in mixed content.
- **Strings are simple, also long prose.** To get a heading for each key,
  start the block with a prose line or add a list.
- Dictionaries that are not pure, and mixed content, get a heading for each
  key.
- Lists become nested Markdown lists. Mixed lists keep their order. A
  primitive value is its text.
- `{Other}` is a copy. Only `@{Other}` makes a link.
- Intrinsic values, strings and references stay different. Piton never gets
  the identity of a reference from a heading.
- Target frontmatter and body layout go around the serialized content.

## 10. `piton.config.pi`

Piton reads this file from the current directory. Its anchors come from the
bundled `@piton/config`. It exports its `piton-config` anchor. The LSP treats
it as config.

```piton
use @piton/config
use @piton/belay
use @piton/packaging
use @piton/test
from @piton/belay import ClaudeCodeAdapter

export piton-config Config:
    root: ./spec
    entry: ./spec/index.pi
    output: ./dist
    renderer: json
    frameworks:
        - {BelayConfiguration}
    packages:
        - {MyPackage}
    dependencies:
        - https://github.com/org/repo
            tag: 1.0
    plugins:
        - {Tests}

belay-config BelayConfiguration:
    codeRoot: ./src
    shapeRoot: ./spec/shape
    adapters:
        - {ClaudeCodeAdapter}

piton-package MyPackage:
    name: my-package
    root: ./spec/pkg

test-config Tests:
    agent: codex
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | Required. The source root. Imports that start with `/` resolve here. |
| `entry` | The default is `index.pi` in `root`. If that file is not there, the result is an error. |
| `output` | The build output. The default is `./dist`. |
| `renderer` | `json` (default), `yaml`, `markdown`. |
| `frameworks` | Framework configs (the `belay-config` of Belay). |
| `packages` | The packages that this repository **offers** (12). |
| `dependencies` | The packages that this project installs (12). |
| `plugins` | Plugin declarations that the project adds, and settings anchors for its plugins (13). Piton warns about an item that is not an anchor and ignores it. |

- With a framework, Piton writes renderer output only if you set `output` or
  `renderer`.
- In `PitonConfig`, all optional fields have the form `:: <type>:: null: null`.
- `FrameworkConfig` (`framework-config`) is an empty abstract.
- `PitonPackage` (`@piton/packaging`) has `name` (optional), `root`
  (required) and `dependencies` (optional).
- You can use the keywords and modules of a bundled framework without
  registration. Each file must still `use` or import what it needs.
- **Registration in `frameworks:` starts the output of the framework.**
  Belay is the only framework.

Config diagnostics: `missing-config`, `unknown-config-key`,
`unknown-framework`, `unknown-adapter`, `invalid-adapter`,
`package-without-root`, `invalid-package-name`, `multiple-pins`.

## 11. Belay

Belay is bundled as `@piton/belay`. It is a vocabulary for agents. Piton
compiles it into the files that agentic tools read.

- Piton does the parse, evaluation, modules, inheritance, reachability and
  rendering.
- Belay adds constructs, its config anchor, special imports and an adapter
  for each platform.
- The platform runs the result. A correct compile does not make a correct
  behaviour.
- The compiler loads the constructs and adapters from the `.pi` files of the
  spec (`spec/scope/belay/anchors/`, `spec/scope/belay/adapters/`). A change
  to `Skill.pi` changes the framework.
- Piton assesses the implementation against the specification. Make lasting
  changes in the Piton source.

### 11.1 `belay-config`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `codeRoot` | Required. The location of the application code. |
| `shapeRoot` | Optional. The location of shape instructions. If you do not set it, `BELAY_SHAPE_ROOT` is the project root and Piton places nothing by shape. |
| `adapters` | Required. `ClaudeCodeAdapter`, `CodexAdapter`, `OpenCodeAdapter`, `MuseAdapter`. |
| `crossDiscovery` | Optional. `separate`: each tool is deployed alone, and each adapter writes a full tree. `allow`: accept that a tool shows the command skills of another tool as usual skills. If not set: one shared project (11.5). |
| `instructionByteLimit` | Optional number. Piton checks it for targets that have a limit. |

Paths are relative to the project root.

### 11.2 Constructs

All constructs extend the abstract `Construct`. It has `description` and
`prompt`, both `:: string:: null: null`. Piton keeps other properties and
writes them as Markdown sections after the prompt.

| Keyword | Extra required property | Meaning and output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instruction` | none | Scoped guidance. **Its location is its meaning.** Piton maps it from `shapeRoot` to `codeRoot` (11.3). Instructions with the same scope go into one file for each target. Piton also keeps them in the shape reference tree. |
| `skill` | `useWhen:: string` (not for vendored skills) | The agent loads it when it needs it. The discovery description is `<description> Use when <useWhen>`. The body is the prompt, then the extra properties. |
| `command` | none | An explicit entry point. Its name is `x-<normalized name>`. It is native or translated for each adapter. |
| `agent` | `role:: string` (not for vendored agents) | Its name is kebab-case. The body starts with `You are a <role>`, then the prompt, then the extra properties. |

- Piton checks required fields on concrete constructs after inheritance.
- Piton does not write a description or prompt that is not there. If a target
  needs a description, the compiler reports `missing-description`. The
  compiler applies this to: Claude Code agents; Codex skills, commands and
  agents; OpenCode skills and agents; Muse skills and commands.
- Piton writes the role and the skill description literally:
  - `role: careful reviewer` → `You are a careful reviewer`.
  - `Reviews code.` with `asked for a review` →
    `Reviews code. Use when asked for a review`.

```piton
use @piton/belay

export skill AnswerSpecQuestions:
    description: Reads the spec and answers questions about it.
    useWhen: asked how part of the specification works
    prompt: Read the spec under spec/ before answering.
    reportFormat: Save every report as a standalone HTML file.
```

`reportFormat` becomes the heading `# Report Format`.

**Native options** are metadata. They are never body text. The options are
`tools`, `model`, `allowed-tools`, `mode`, `permission`, `agent`,
`model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`.

- An option that the target does not support gives `unsupported-option`.
- A bad value gives `invalid-option`.
- The types of these options are an open decision (11.7).

**Vendored skills.** The `files` property of a skill (`:: string:: dictionary`)
names a folder. Piton copies the folder next to `SKILL.md`.

- Piton copies each regular file byte for byte. It keeps the relative path
  and the execute bit. It renders or changes nothing.
- The manifest records each file, so a later build can remove it.
- A symlink in the folder is an error. A path that is not a directory in the
  project is an error.
- If the folder holds a `SKILL.md`, that file *is* the skill. The anchor
  cannot set other properties (`vendored-conflict`).
- The `name` in that file must agree with the Belay name
  (`vendored-name-mismatch`). It must have a description where the target
  needs one. `useWhen` is then not required.

**Vendored agents.** The `file` property of an agent names its native
definition. Use this to keep native settings that Belay cannot carry to all
targets, such as the `tools` and `model` of Claude.

- The file is `.md`, or `.toml` for Codex. Another extension is an error.
- Piton writes the file without a change.
- Each other property on the anchor is an error.
- If the agent format of the target holds a name, the name must agree with
  the Belay name.
- The file must have a description where the target needs one.

Rules for `files` and `file`:

- The value is one path, or a dictionary from target id to path.
- A key that is not a target id is an error.
- A built target that the dictionary does not name gives
  `missing-vendored-target`.
- `null` writes nothing for that target.
- A path resolves from the `.pi` file that declares it, or from the source
  root if it starts with `/`.
- If a target reads the copy of another target, Piton writes no copy. If
  `files` names a different folder for that target, Piton gives a warning.

With these rules, a tethered package can carry a skill from an upstream
project without conversion:

```piton
use @piton/belay

export skill Impeccable:
    files:
        claude-code: ./vendor/claude/impeccable
        codex: ./vendor/codex/impeccable
        opencode: ./vendor/opencode/impeccable
```

### 11.3 Shape mapping

- Piton takes the directory of an instruction relative to `shapeRoot`. It
  resolves that directory below `codeRoot`.
- If the directory is not there, Piton goes up to the nearest directory that
  exists. **It stops at `codeRoot`.**
- Examples:
  - `spec/shape/components/button/Button.pi` →
    `src/components/button/AGENTS.md`.
  - Two files in `input/` combine into one file.
  - `components/nonexistent/` → `src/components/AGENTS.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` here is only the generic name. Each adapter uses its own
  instruction file name.
- The file has a heading for each instruction (`# Button Shape`).
- The fallback changes only the location. The shape reference tree keeps the
  original path.
- Instructions outside `shapeRoot` are an open decision. The compiler gives
  an error (`instruction-placement-unspecified`).
- A location never makes sure that the tool loads the file at the start
  (11.5).

### 11.4 References and special imports

- Belay writes only what the build writes: the entry exports and the items
  that they refer to.
- Piton writes the anchors that it reaches to the `referenceRoot` of the
  adapter. It writes **one Markdown file for each source module**, at its
  path below `root`. Each anchor is a heading.
  Example: `spec/components/Button.pi` →
  `.claude/reference/components/Button.md`.
- This tree, with its `shape/` subdirectory, is not a discovery directory of
  a platform. An agent reaches it only through links.
- `@{X}` becomes a relative link with a fragment:
  `[Button](../../reference/components/Button.md#button)`. The link is lazy.
  It is never an `@import` of Claude.
- A reference to a skill, command or agent links to the output of that
  construct (for example its `SKILL.md`). Piton does not copy it.

**Special imports** come from `@piton/belay`. Piton resolves them for each
adapter and each output file. The result is a path relative to the generated
file. Use them with `${...}`. Piton resolves them at compile time, not when
the agent runs.

| Import | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `BELAY_COMPILED_SHAPE` | The compiled shape tree of the adapter (`.claude/reference/shape`). |
| `BELAY_AGENT_ROOT` | `.claude`, `.codex`, `.opencode` or `.muse`. |
| `BELAY_PROJECT_ROOT` | The directory of `piton.config.pi`. |
| `BELAY_SHAPE_ROOT` | `shapeRoot`, or the project root. |
| `BELAY_CODE_ROOT` | `codeRoot`. |

- `prompt: Read ${BELAY_COMPILED_SHAPE} first.` in
  `.claude/skills/designer/SKILL.md` becomes `../../reference/shape`.
- You can combine them:
  `export FLUENCY_PROMPT_FILE: ${BELAY_PROJECT_ROOT}/FLUENCY_PROMPT.md`.

### 11.5 Adapters

Each adapter extends the abstract `belay-agent-adapter`. It has
`description`, `targetId`, `instructionFile` and `referenceRoot`. It also has
`documentationChecked`. The default is `2026-09-21`. For Muse it is
`2026-10-13` (Muse Code 1.4.7). The manifest records it in `targets`.

| | Claude Code (`claude-code`) | Codex (`codex`) | OpenCode (`opencode`) | Muse (`muse`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Reference root | `.claude/reference` | `.codex/reference` | `.opencode/reference` | `.muse/reference` |
| Skill | `.claude/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`. Frontmatter `name`, `description`. The directory is the name. | `.agents/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`, the same. | `.opencode/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`. Name: 1–64 lowercase letters and digits, single hyphens, the same as the directory. Description: 1–1024 characters. | `.agents/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`. A description is always required. Never write `allowed-tools`. |
| Command | `.claude/skills/x-<n>/SKILL.md` with `disable-model-invocation: true`. Call it with `/x-<n>`. Never also write `.claude/commands/`. | `.agents/skills/x-<n>/SKILL.md` and `agents/openai.yaml` with `policy: allow_implicit_invocation: false`. Call it with `$x-<n>`. | Native `.opencode/commands/x-<n>.md`. Call it with `/x-<n>`. | Translated: `.agents/skills/x-<n>/SKILL.md` with `disable-model-invocation: true`. Call it with `/x-<n>`. |
| Agent | `.claude/agents/<n>.md`: `name`, `description`, optional `tools`, `model`. | `.codex/agents/<n>.toml`: `name`, `description`, `developer_instructions` (one TOML string: role, prompt, extras), optional `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`. | `.opencode/agents/<n>.md`: `description`, `mode` (`primary`, `subagent` or `all`; always explicit; default `subagent`), optional `model`, `permission`. The file name is the identity. It has no `name` field. | **Not supported.** No file. Warning `unsupported-construct`. Piton never changes it into a skill. |
| Native options | Agent: `tools`, `model`. Skill and command: `allowed-tools`, `model`. | Agent only: `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`. | Agent: `mode`, `model`, `permission`. Command: `agent`, `model`. | None. Approval mode, sandbox and permission profiles belong to Muse. |
| Load | Ancestor files at the start. Nested files when Claude reads that subtree. | The chain from the root to the current directory at the start. A same-directory `AGENTS.override.md` hides the file (`shadowed-instruction`). Byte limit (`instruction-over-budget`). | It searches up from the current directory. It prefers `AGENTS.md` to `CLAUDE.md`. Do not assume that it loads nested files (`unguaranteed-instruction-scope`). It also finds `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`. | Rules files from the current directory up to the workspace root, only in trusted workspaces. `AGENTS.md` wins against a same-directory `CLAUDE.md`, which it ignores with a warning. Descendant files are not sure to load. Skills come from `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, in that priority. It keeps one copy. It obeys the `disable-model-invocation` of Claude and the `openai.yaml` policy of Codex. |

Rules for all adapters:

- The pipeline has these steps:
  1. Take the validated constructs, after imports and inheritance.
  2. Make one plan for each adapter.
  3. Resolve locations and reference destinations.
  4. Check shared paths and cross discovery across the full plan.
  5. Serialize.
  6. Validate links, metadata, names and ownership.
  7. Write.
- Piton diagnoses requested capabilities that a target does not support
  before it writes output.
- Each behaviour is native, translated or not supported. If Piton cannot show
  a required behaviour, it fails with a diagnostic that tells you what to do.
- Never change an agent into a skill without a diagnostic. Never change a
  command into a skill that the model can start.
- Piton writes model and permission settings only if you configure them. It
  does not write settings that are not configured.
- Piton validates options against the platform. Prose never goes into
  metadata. Target settings stay apart from extra prose properties.
- **A prompt that asks for restraint does not enforce it.** Claim enforcement
  only for platform controls. A translation never gives more access.
- The `allowed-tools` and the subagent `tools` of Claude are different.
  Neither is a portable sandbox.
- A restriction that Piton must enforce but cannot show is a diagnostic.
- Piton normalizes names before it makes the plan. Commands keep `x-`.
- Collisions give `name-collision` or `output-collision`. Two items with the
  same content, references and activation are not a collision.
- Generated links are relative. They must point to planned outputs
  (`broken-reference-link`). Piton does not check Markdown links that you
  write by hand.
- Piton writes metadata and body one time. A real YAML or TOML encoder writes
  frontmatter. Piton checks file names and metadata against the target schema
  before it writes.

**Many adapters share one project**, because the tools read the files of each
other:

- The first adapter in the list owns the single reference tree, with the
  compiled shape. All adapters link into it. The other adapters write no
  reference tree.
- With one adapter, or with `separate`, each adapter owns its own tree.
- The first adapter in the list writes a shared instruction path
  (`AGENTS.md`) one time. Muse shares the `AGENTS.md` of Codex and OpenCode.
- If a tool finds the skill directory of another enabled adapter, its adapter
  writes no copy of a skill that the other adapter writes there. It links to
  that skill. OpenCode and Muse do this for Claude Code and Codex skills.
  Muse also does it for commands, because it obeys their activation metadata.
- A construct that a target does not support (a Muse agent) links to the
  artifact of another adapter. If there is none, it links to its reference
  document.
- OpenCode finds the `x-` command skills of other adapters. This gives
  `cross-discovery-activation`. Two settings stop the error:
  - `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc` denies them:
    `"permission": {"skill": {"x-*": "deny"}}`. The last pattern that matches
    wins. This rule does not change the native `x-` commands of OpenCode.
  - `crossDiscovery` is set.
- A tool that finds one skill in more than one directory gives a
  `cross-target-discovery` warning. This does not apply if the tool keeps
  only one copy (Muse).
- With `crossDiscovery: separate`, each adapter writes a full tree. Writes to
  one path that do not agree give `output-collision`.

Rules for each adapter:

- **Claude Code**:
  - The agent identity comes from the normalized name, never from a heading.
  - Never copy `tools` or `allowed-tools` to another target without a mapping.
  - Claude Code still supports `.claude/commands/`. Belay writes commands as
    skills.
  - Nested instructions keep their mapped scope and links relative to the
    target.
- **Codex**:
  - Do not write `AGENTS.override.md` to win precedence. Diagnose a
    same-directory `AGENTS.override.md`.
  - Codex does not have to load guidance below the start directory.
  - The limit is `instructionByteLimit`.
  - Do not write deprecated custom prompts. Do not make a `.codex/commands/`
    directory.
  - Never map generic `tools`.
  - Use only the standalone format for custom agents.
  - Guidance cannot change the sandbox or the approval policy.
  - Piton diagnoses tool and model settings on a command.
  - A command must make both of its files.
  - The agent TOML must parse and have its three fields.
- **OpenCode**:
  - Do not assume nested loads or chains.
  - Give more guidance only through explicit `instructions` config, never
    global config.
  - Shape scope that is required but that OpenCode cannot make sure of is an
    error.
  - Frontmatter that OpenCode does not know enforces nothing.
  - `model` includes the provider.
  - Keep command argument placeholders.
  - OpenCode never enforces `allowed-tools` on commands.
  - Agents use `permission`, not the deprecated `tools`. Map them only when
    the meaning is the same.
  - Refuse conversions that are not clear.
  - Keep the location, but do not claim that activation is the same in all
    tools.
- **Muse**:
  - Commands keep `x-` and `disable-model-invocation`.
  - Piton reports each agent as not supported. Muse takes agents only from
    plugins or from an overlay for one run. A build can write neither.
  - Piton still writes the reference tree.

Other diagnostics: `invalid-artifact-name`, `missing-command-prefix`,
`description-too-long`, `output-outside-project`, `unowned-output`,
`duplicated-content`, `unrepresentable-reference`.

### 11.6 Guarantees

- The same source, configuration, directory state and toolchain give the
  same bytes.
- Combined instructions have a stable order.
- Piton quotes and escapes frontmatter correctly for each format.
- Piton reports reference targets that are not there and metadata that a
  target does not support. It does not hide them.
- `.piton/manifest.json` records generated files and the documentation date
  of each target. Thus a cleanup never deletes user files.
- A failure names the source anchor and property.
- Output stays in its boundaries.

### 11.7 Open decisions (`spec/scope/belay/Decisions.pi`)

If your work needs one of these decisions, say "unspecified". Do not guess.
Tell the user about it.

- Instructions outside `shapeRoot`.
- The types of `tools`, `allowed-tools` and `model`, and their mapping for
  each adapter.
- Names: normalization of skill file names and command names, the split of
  acronyms, and collisions.
- Workflows: are they always compositions of the four constructs? Do not add
  a `workflow` keyword.
- How Piton writes options that are specific to a platform.

## 12. Packages

A package is a git repository or a local directory. Piton **vendors** it
into the project, and you commit it. Piton fetches nothing at compile time.

Offer packages:

- List `piton-package` anchors under `packages:` in the config. You can
  declare them in any file.
- `root` is relative to the config.
- One repository can offer many packages. Each has its own root and
  dependencies.
- **A project never installs its own packages.**

Names:

- The name is `name` (it can be kebab-case), else the anchor name.
- Names are flat and have no `/`.
- `@piton/...` is reserved for bundled packages.

Dependencies:

- Each dependency is a source. It can have one indented `commit:`, `tag:` or
  `branch:`.
- More than one pin gives `multiple-pins`. The compiler also gives
  `dangling-pin` and `unknown-pin`.
- With no pin, Piton takes the head of the default branch.
- Pins are strings: `tag: 1.0` → `"1.0"`.
- To select some packages of a repository, write `packages: [ui-kit]` below
  the source. Without it, Piton takes all packages.

Local sources:

- A local source is an absolute path, `~/...`, or a relative path. Piton reads
  a relative path from the directory of the `piton.config.pi` that lists it.
- A value with a scheme (`https://`, `file://`) or `git@host:path` is a URL.
- Piton clones a git directory like a URL. You can pin it, and the lock
  records its commit. Piton takes only committed content. It warns about
  changes that are not committed.
- Piton copies a plain directory as it is now. A pin on it is an error. The
  lock records no commit. `update` takes its current content.
- You cannot tether a directory that holds the project.
- A package from a local directory can list relative path dependencies. A
  package from a URL cannot.

Rules:

- Project dependencies and package dependencies are separate. **Packages do
  not nest.**
- If versions conflict, the newest commit wins, and Piton gives a warning.
- **Install**: Piton installs into `tethers/<name>` next to the config. The
  directory holds the files of the package `root`. Piton removes all git
  traces.
- A repository that offers no packages installs complete, below the name
  that its URL gives.
- **Atomic**: Piton resolves and checks all packages before it writes
  anything. If one package fails or conflicts, Piton places none. The config,
  `tethers/` and the lock do not change.
- Piton adds a source only if it can also fetch all that the source requires.
- **Two packages cannot share a name.** This applies to a name that another
  source already tethered, a name that the project offers, and a name
  published twice in one install. The result is an error, never a
  replacement. Use `--as` to give a new name.
- **Import** by name: `from my-package import X`, `use my-package`,
  `use my-package/X`. The package name is a placeholder for a path. If the
  package is not there, the result is an error.
- **Lock**: `.piton/tether.lock` is next to `piton.config.pi`. It holds the
  URL, commit and file hash of each package. `tether` and `update` write it.
  Commit it.
- **Edits**: each operation first compares the files with the lock. If you
  edited a package, the operation stops. It tells you to use `untether` or
  `update --force`.

Commands:

| Command | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `piton tether [source] [--as name]` | Without a source: install all dependencies. With a URL or directory: install it, then add it to `dependencies`. Piton reads a relative path from the current directory and writes it relative to the config. |
| `piton update [packages...] [--force] [--diff]` | Install again. The default is all packages. |
| `piton untether <pkg> [--as name] [--no-rewrite]` | Move the package to `<root>/untethered/` and change the imports. It becomes project source. `--no-rewrite` moves the package and changes no imports. |
| `piton remove <pkg>` | Delete the package and remove it from `dependencies`. The command refuses if you edited the package or if a file imports it. |

`update` flags:

- `--force` discards your edits. It gives a warning for each package with
  the changes.
- `--diff` compares the content on disk before the update (with local edits)
  to the new content. It shows each changed region with 3 context lines.
- `--diff` shows old and new line numbers. An unchanged line shows both. A
  removed line shows the old number. An added line shows the new number.
- A separator line goes between regions. For each package, it shows how many
  files changed, or that none changed.
- If `update` refuses because of edits, it shows the edits. It fetches the
  package again at the locked commit and compares it with the disk.
- Piton calculates the diff itself. It does not need `diff`. On a terminal,
  it uses red and green.

## 13. Plugins (`spec/scope/plugins/`)

Plugins add CLI commands, and Piton files that you can import. They do not
change the compiler.

- You declare a plugin in Piton and write it in TypeScript.
- oxc transpiles the code. Embedded QuickJS (rquickjs) runs it.
- You install nothing. Plugins need no Node and no build step.
- **Compilation stays pure.** `check`, `build` and the LSP read only the Piton
  declaration. Plugin code runs only when you start its command.
- **A plugin can do only what it declares.**
- Bundled plugins and installed plugins work the same. The binary holds the
  files of a bundled plugin.
- Not available now: hooks into build or check, renderers, diagnostics, and
  replacement of Belay.

### 13.1 Declaration (`@piton/plugin`)

```piton
use @piton/plugin

export piton-plugin TestPlugin:
    name: test

| Field | Rules |
| --- | --- |
| `name:: string` | Required. Lowercase with hyphens. The Piton files of a bundled plugin are `@piton/<name>`. If two plugins have the same name, Piton reports the second and does not load it. |
| `entry:: string` | Required. A TS or JS module relative to the declaring file. It must be in that directory and it must exist. Its default export is `definePlugin(...)`. |
| `description` | Optional string. `piton plugins` shows it. |
| `settings` | Optional string. The name of an abstract anchor that the plugin exports. A settings anchor of a project implements it. |
| `commands` | Optional dictionary. See below. |
| `capabilities` | Optional dictionary (13.2). Without it, the plugin can only read the project. |

Commands:

- The key is the command name. It is lowercase with hyphens and comes after
  `piton`.
- `about` is one line. It shows in `piton --help` and at the top of the
  command help.
- `help` gives more text. It shows in `piton <command> --help`.
- `arguments` is an ordered dictionary.
- If a command has the same name as a command of another plugin or a
  built-in command, Piton reports it and leaves it out.

Argument settings are all optional: `help`, `positional`, `multiple`, `type`
(`string` is the default, `number`, `flag`), `choices`, `short` (one letter),
`minimum`, `conflicts`.

- The key is the long option.
- A positional argument cannot have the type `flag` or a short name.
- An unknown setting makes the declaration not valid. A `conflicts` value
  that names an argument that is not there also makes it not valid.
- Values come to the handler by name: a flag gives a boolean, a number gives
  a number, `multiple` gives a list, and an absent value gives null.
- clap checks values first (choices, minimum), as for built-in commands.
- A declaration with a bad form gives a warning that names the file. Piton
  skips only that plugin.

### 13.2 Capabilities

A plugin can always read the compiled project. It must list all other
operations. An unknown capability makes the declaration not valid.

| Capability | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `process: [names]` | The programs that the plugin can run and find on PATH. The names must be exact. |
| `files: read \| none` | The default is `none`. `read` lets the plugin read files in the project, never outside it. |
| `temporaryFiles: true` | Temporary files outside the project. Piton removes them when the command ends. |

- Plugins never write project files. Their output goes to stdout and stderr.
- A refused operation throws an error, for example: "plugin `hello` may not
  run `ls`: its declaration does not list it under capabilities.process".
  The plugin can catch it. If it does not catch it, the command fails.
- Capabilities do not put the programs that a plugin runs in a sandbox.

### 13.3 Sources

- All bundled plugins are always present. Now there is only `test`, at
  `plugins/test` (`pi/`, `plugin.pi`, `src/`).
- A project adds a plugin when it lists the `piton-plugin` anchor under
  `plugins:`. Piton reads the code from the directory of the declaring file.
- To share a plugin, put it in a package. The project imports the
  declaration from the package and lists it under `plugins:`. Import the
  Piton files of the plugin by the package name.
- Settings: an anchor that implements the settings abstract of the plugin.
  For bundled plugins it comes from the package of the plugin (for example
  `test-config`). List it under `plugins:`.
- A plugin has one settings anchor at most. Two settings anchors give an
  error when the plugin reads them.
- The plugin validates the values itself. It reports a bad value where you
  wrote it.
- Piton warns about other items under `plugins:`.
- Piton finds plugins from the config on each `piton` run. It reads only
  Piton.
- The config must have no errors before a plugin command runs. Plugin
  problems are warnings.

### 13.4 Runtime

- Piton transpiles each module when the plugin imports it. It removes types
  and does no lowering. `.js` and `.mjs` files stay as they are.
- As in TypeScript, Piton removes an import that nothing uses as a value.
- A syntax error gives the file and the line.
- A plugin can import `@piton/plugin` and relative files. Piton tries the
  path as it is, then `.ts`, `.js`, `/index.ts`. A plugin can never import a
  file outside its directory.
- Each command run gets one runtime.
- The event loop has one thread. The command ends when the promise of the
  handler settles.
- If the plugin waits for something that cannot answer, the command fails.
  It does not hang.
- At exit, Piton stops all processes that the plugin started and removes the
  temporary files.
- A throw or a load failure fails the command. Piton shows the plugin name,
  the error and the JS stack, and exits with 1.

### 13.5 API

The API is in `crates/piton-plugin/api/index.ts`. For editors, a
`tsconfig.json` maps `@piton/plugin` to it, with strict checks and no emit.
Piton never reads that file.

```typescript
import { definePlugin, type Context, type Json } from "@piton/plugin";

async function hello(ctx: Context, args: Record<string, Json>) {
  const compiled = ctx.compile({ workspace: true });
  for (const anchor of compiled.anchors({ exported: true, withinSourceRoot: true })) {
    ctx.stdout(`${anchor.name}\n`);
  }
  ctx.report.done("listed the anchors");
  return 0;
}

export default definePlugin({ commands: { hello } });
```

A handler returns the exit code. If it returns nothing, the code is 0.

| Context member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin` | The plugin. |
| `terminal` | Is it a tty, the width, and colour (`NO_COLOR`). |
| `project` | Absolute root, source root, entry, output, config path, Belay code root and adapters. |
| `settings` | The settings anchor, or null. |
| `compile({workspace})` | Compile the project. `workspace` compiles all sources below the root. |
| `spawn` | Run a permitted program with args, an optional cwd in the project, and env. It runs in the project root with an empty stdin. |
| `onPath` | Is a program on PATH. |
| `readFile`, `temporaryFile`, `sleep` | Read a file, make a temporary file, wait. |
| `paint` | Styles: error, warning, success, help, note, name, heading, dim. |
| `stdout`, `stderr` | Write text. They remove colour as the compiler does. |
| `stderrRaw` | Write to stderr without a change. |
| `report` | error, warning, help and note messages. Piton keeps them until the end and shows a count. `done` and `stopped` write the outcome line. |
| `agents` | The known tools: name, program, Belay target, fluency prompt. |
| `reportDiagnostics` | Show the diagnostics of a compilation as `piton check` does. Tell if any were errors. |

`compiled.anchors({extends: {module, name}, exported, concrete, withinSourceRoot})`:

- It returns anchors in order of file, then name.
- Each anchor has name, file, exported, abstract, keyword, resolved
  properties and location.
- `extends` does not include the named anchor itself. A module that nothing
  loaded matches nothing.
- `withinSourceRoot` does not include `tethers/` or bundled packages.
- The location is where the anchor names the property itself, else where
  its name is.

Property values are JSON:

- Strings are plain. References show as names.
- Implicit lists are lists.
- An anchor value is `{$anchor: name}`. A reference is `{$reference: name}`.

Other API rules:

- A located diagnostic renders like a compiler diagnostic. The plugin selects
  its code. The default code is the plugin name.
- Process output comes line by line, with the tag stdout or stderr. The
  stream ends after the process exits and all lines are read.
- If a signal stopped the process, the exit code is null.
- Await many processes together to run them in parallel.

### 13.6 `piton plugins`

- It lists bundled plugins, then declared plugins.
- For each plugin it shows: name, origin, description, commands, settings
  anchor, package and capabilities. If the plugin has no capabilities, it
  tells you that the plugin can only read the project.
- Problems come before the outcome line.
- The outcome line gives the count of plugins. The exit code is 0.

## 14. Tests (`spec/scope/testing/`, bundled plugin)

A test is a plain English statement. An agent judges whether it is true or
false against the spec, the code or both. A test checks meaning. A compile
cannot check meaning.

```piton
use @piton/test

export test SaveButtonSaves:
    expects: The Save button saves the document
    against: code
    tags: [editor, save]
```

`Test` (`test`) fields:

| Field | Rules |
| --- | --- |
| `expects:: string` | Required. The statement. |
| `against` | Optional: `spec`, `code` or `both`. |
| `description` | Optional. Context for the agent. It never changes the statement. |
| `tags:: string[]` | Optional. Piton trims tags and drops empty tags. Tags only select tests. Piton never sends them to the agent. |

Discovery:

- A test is each exported concrete anchor with the `Test` of `@piton/test`
  in its chain.
- Piton finds tests anywhere below the source root. The entry does not have
  to reach them, because Piton compiles the full root.
- Piton skips tests without an export. Tests in `tethers/` do not belong to
  the project.
- The order is by file, then by name.

`TestConfig` (`test-config`, listed under `plugins:`):

| Field | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `against` | `spec`, `code`, `both` | `both` |
| `agent` | `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `muse` | `claude` |
| `jobs` | a whole number, 1 or more | `4` |

- Bad values give an error where you wrote them: `invalid-test-scope`,
  `unknown-test-agent`, `invalid-jobs`.
- A bad choice value (in settings, in a test or on the CLI) gives an error
  that names the correct choices. Nothing runs.
- Precedence:
  - `against`: CLI flag › test › settings › `both`.
  - `agent` and `jobs`: CLI flag › settings › `claude` or `4`. A test cannot
    set them.

### 14.1 `piton test`

`piton test [targets...] [--agent] [--against] [--jobs/-j N] [--serial] [--list] [--tags EXPR]`

Targets:

- Piton first tries a target as an exact test name. Else it is a path to a
  file or directory, relative to the project root or absolute.
- Targets and tags combine with AND.
- An empty selection is an error. A target that matches nothing is an error.
- A project without tests succeeds with a report.
- `--serial` is the same as `--jobs 1`. `--jobs` with `--serial` is an
  error. `jobs` less than 1 is an error.

Tag expressions:

- Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`, parentheses. `&&`, `||` and `!` are the
  same.
- `not` before a term negates it. `not` between two terms means "and not":
  `editor not slow`.
- `not` binds most tightly. Then come `and` and infix `not`. Then comes `or`.
- Tags match exactly, with case. A test without tags matches only through
  `not`.
- A tag is a run of characters without spaces, parentheses, `!`, `&` or `|`.
  Examples: `needs-network`, `v1.2`. `and`, `or` and `not` cannot be tags.
- A parse error tells what Piton expected and where. Piton then compiles
  nothing.

The order of checks:

1. Config.
2. Flags.
3. Test settings.
4. Tag expression.
5. Compile and collect. Compile errors stop all work. Tests with a bad form
   (empty `expects`, bad `against`) also stop all work. Piton reports each by
   name with its file.
6. `--list` stops here.
7. The tool must be on PATH. Else the error tells you to use `--agent`.

What the agent reads:

| Scope | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `spec` | The `.pi` files below the source root, and the fluency prompt. |
| `code` | The Belay `codeRoot`. Without it: the project root, without the source root, `tethers/`, the output and the generated agent directories. |
| `both` | The statement must be true in each. |

The session:

- Each test is one headless session in the project root, with an empty stdin.
  Piton asks for read-only access.
- The request gives the statement, description, name, file, scope, and the
  source root and code root relative to the project.
- The agent must not change, create or delete files. It must judge on
  evidence. A statement fails when evidence contradicts it or when there is
  no evidence.
- The agent ends with one line:
  `PITON-VERDICT: {"pass": false, "reason": "...", "explanation": "..."}`.
- `pass` is a boolean. `explanation` is required when `pass` is false.
- The last valid verdict line counts. Piton accepts backticks around it. The
  request that the agent shows again does not count, because its example is
  not valid JSON.
- For Claude, the answer is its message text and the final result. For other
  tools, it is stdout, then stderr.
- If the tool gives no reason, `reason` is empty.

The explanation:

- The agent writes it on the verdict line in the same session. It costs no
  extra run.
- Piton asks for ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English: 4 sentences or
  fewer, 20 words or fewer each, approved words, one word for one meaning,
  technical names as they are, one topic in each sentence, active voice,
  simple present, past or future tense, no -ing forms, no contractions, no
  phrasal verbs, articles, noun clusters of 3 words or fewer.
- It tells what is not there or different, and where.
- Piton shows it as written and does not check it. Piton keeps it only when
  `pass` is false. A failure without an explanation still fails and shows
  only the reason.

Errors:

- A nonzero exit or no verdict is an *error*. The test is not judged.
- The error shows the exit code and the last three lines of stderr (or
  stdout). It can also say that the session ended without a verdict line.

How Piton starts each tool:

| Tool | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Claude | `claude -p <request> --append-system-prompt <fluency> --allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob --disallowedTools Edit,Write,NotebookEdit,Bash --output-format stream-json --verbose` |
| Codex | `codex exec --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check -c developer_instructions=<TOML string> <request>` |
| OpenCode | `opencode run --standalone <request>`, with `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` that names a temporary fluency file and denies edit and bash |
| Muse | `muse exec -c run.developer_prompt=<JSON string> <request>`, in the sandbox of Muse |

Piton never claims more enforcement than the tool gives.

Output:

- Tests run in parallel, up to `jobs`. Piton shows each test when it ends.
  With `--serial`, it shows them in list order.
- Results go to stdout as blocks with blank lines between them.
- For each test:
  - `✓ pass`, `✗ FAIL` or `! error`, the name (shortened with an ellipsis if
    too long), and the duration `m:ss` at the right.
  - The file and tags, dimmed.
  - The reason. It wraps at spaces and is indented below the name.
  - For failures, the explanation behind a coloured bar.
- The width is the terminal width of stdout, up to 100. When piped, it is 100.
- If a test did not pass, a "Not passing" recap follows. It has one line for
  each test: status, name and file.
- The outcome goes to stderr: `✓ 9 tests passed in 4:12` or
  `✗ 9 tests: 7 passed, 1 failed, 1 could not be judged in 4:12`.
- On a terminal, a status block shows a spinner, counts, and for each test
  that runs, its time and last tool action. Results print above it. It
  disappears at the end.
- The last action of Claude reads like "reading `<path>`" or "searching
  `<dir>` for a pattern", with paths relative to the project. It also shows
  the first line of what Claude says. During its first turn, it shows
  "thinking". Other tools show their last printed line.
- Without a terminal, Piton writes a "running <name>" line when each test
  starts.
- `--list` shows tests in groups by file, with blank lines between files. For
  each test: the name, `against` and tags (dimmed), and the wrapped
  statement. The outcome is `✓ 9 tests in 3 files`. It runs nothing and needs
  no tool.
- Colour: green, red and yellow status, bold names, highlighted files, dim
  details and times. With `NO_COLOR` or a pipe, the text is plain.
- Exit code: 0 on success, 1 on failures or errors.

## 15. CLI

General rules for each command:

- It shows the results first, then a bold ✓ or ✗ outcome line.
- Then it shows diagnostics, with help and notes.
- Then it shows a count of errors and warnings. It does not show the count
  after a clean run, unless the command is a check.
- On a terminal: errors are red and warnings are yellow. Names that you type
  are highlighted. Depths, counts and provenance are dim. Paths have `+` and
  `-` marks, with a dim directory part.
- Colours and marks never carry information that the words do not carry.
- With a pipe or `NO_COLOR`, the text is plain. Bare results go to stdout.
- `piton --version`, and the version that the LSP reports, is major.minor
  from `Cargo.toml` with the commit count as the patch (for example
  `0.1.57`). `PITON_VERSION` overrides it. Without git, it is the
  `Cargo.toml` version.
- Plugin commands (`piton test`) show in `--help` next to the built-in
  commands. They cannot replace built-in commands.
- Each command is a `cli-command` anchor (`spec/scope/tooling/cli/index.pi`)
  with `commandName`, `positionalArguments` and `namedArguments`.

| Command | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `check [paths...]` | Validates syntax, imports, references, types, inheritance, composition, exports and cycles. Writes nothing. Exits with 1 on errors. A path is a file or a glob. The default is the project. |
| `build [config] [--dry-run]` | Writes `<output>/<path below root>.<ext>` for the entry and for each file that holds an item its exports refer to. |
| `compile <path> [--renderer json\|yaml\|markdown] [--write] [--dependencies]` | Compiles one file to stdout, with a key for each export. |
| `format [path] [--check]` | Writes the canonical format. |
| `reach [targets...] [--no-unreachable] [--no-paths]` | Shows what is reachable and what is not. |
| `slice <target> [--adapter <id>]` | Shows the spec that one item needs, as one Markdown document. |
| `init [dir] [--template group/name] [--adapter id...] [--list] [--no-tether]` | Makes a new project from a template. |
| `loc [paths...]` | Shows total, code, comment and blank lines for each file, and a summary. Exits with 0. |
| `lsp` | Starts the language server on stdio (16). |
| `agent [claude\|codex\|opencode\|muse] [--print-fluency] [args...]` | Starts an agentic tool with this prompt. |
| `plugins` | Section 13.6. |
| `test` | Section 14 (plugin). |
| `tether`, `update`, `untether`, `remove` | Section 12. |

**`build`**:

- If no `entry` is set, the entry is `index.pi` in the root. If that file is
  not there, the result is an error.
- Example: `spec/components/Button.pi` → `dist/components/Button.json`.
- The output of a registered framework replaces the renderer output. If you
  set `output` or `renderer`, Piton writes both. A Claude Code project gets
  `.claude` and nothing in `dist`.
- The build validates the full plan before it writes.
- `.piton/manifest.json` is in `.piton/`, next to `piton.config.pi`. Its shape
  is `{generated: [...], targets: {targetId: documentationChecked}}`.
  `targets` records the date when someone last checked the documentation of
  each framework target.

**`compile`**:

- `--renderer` has the default `json`.
- It does not show items without an export, or abstract anchors.
- `--write` writes the output next to each input. Glob paths need `--write`.
- `--dependencies` wraps the output as
  `{"value": "<output string>", "dependencies": [abs paths]}`. It does not
  include bundled files.

**`format`**:

- The canonical format: 4 spaces, constraint spacing, sorted and wrapped
  imports, no `.pi` in paths, a space after `//`.
- Without a path, it formats all sources below the source root. It does not
  change the output, dependency directories or installed packages.
- `format -` reads stdin and writes stdout.
- **It only splits long lines. It never joins paragraphs again.** When you
  edit prose, wrap it again by hand. Do not wrap `key: value` blocks as
  prose.

**`reach`**:

- It starts from files, globs or anchor names. The default is the project
  (its entry).
- It follows imports, references, inheritance and composition. This includes
  variables that a value embeds and properties that a value reads.
- It shows each reachable item with its depth and path. It also shows
  unreachable items. Results are in groups by source, with direct and
  indirect reach.
- It counts each anchor one time. An anchor that lost a duplicate export
  counts where its declaration is.
- `piton.config.pi` is never unreachable.
- Piton parses files that nothing imports (it does not compile them) to
  count their anchors. It lists them as `(never imported, N anchors)`.
- Summary: `37 anchors reachable, 412 unreachable (380 in 50 never-imported
  files)`. The unreachable count includes those files. The parenthesis shows
  when such files exist, also when their anchor count is 0.
- Then: `53 modules loaded, 2 carrying nothing reachable, 50 never imported`.
- Use it to find dead spec. It gives no diagnostics and always exits with 0.

**`slice`**:

- Target forms: `file.pi#Anchor`, `#Anchor.property`, `#variable`, or a bare
  name that is unique in the project.
- Piton finds the project through the nearest `piton.config.pi` above the
  current directory.
- It follows these dependencies, transitively:
  - A full anchor needs all its properties and each anchor that it extends.
  - A property needs each base that declares that property.
  - Constraint types, values that it reads, references and embedded items.
  - A variable needs what it reads, refers to or embeds, and its constraint
    anchors.
  - Imports alone add nothing.
- A property slice does not show the other properties of the anchor.
- It adds the **chain** from the entry to the target. The chain is the
  shortest build path, with one property for each link. Piton traces it from
  the entry also when the target is a file. Entry exports, variables and
  files that the build does not reach have no chain. The introduction names
  the links of the chain.
- Order: the target, then dependencies with the nearest first (source order
  for ties), then the chain with the outermost first.
- Each declaration shows one time, with its name, file, bases, type and
  reads. Values look as the Markdown renderer writes them. References show as
  names.
- Piton follows a cycle until it comes back to the start, and lists each
  dependency in it. Markdown links that you wrote stay the same.
- Paths are relative to the current directory. The output is deterministic.
- `--adapter <id>` (for example `claude-code`) cites the compiled outputs
  instead of the `.pi` files:
  - The target must be an item that the build writes. Piton compiles the
    project from its entry as a build does. You do not have to run
    `piton build` first.
  - Each declaration is shown in its file below its heading. Citations become
    links, for example `.claude/reference/ui.md#color`.
  - An embedded anchor is shown in the section that embeds it.
  - Piton never cites the source. Abstract items and items that are only read
    have no location. Names that cite them are not links.
- Errors: a file that is not there, a name that is not declared or imported,
  a property that is not there, a bare name with more than one match, a path
  that goes into a property.
- Errors with `--adapter`: no Belay config, a target that the project does
  not build, a file that the build does not reach, an anchor that Piton never
  writes.
- It exits with 1 on errors.

**`init`**:

- Templates are in the binary. `init` needs no network for them.

| Template | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `crux/project` | The preferred group. It is first in the list, marked "recommended". Belay, with https://github.com/piton-lang/crux.git declared. `init` tethers it, and the entry exports it again. |
| `piton/minimal` | JSON in `dist/`. |
| `piton/library` | A package that other projects install with `piton tether`. |
| `belay/application` | A shape instruction in `src/`, a skill, an agent and a command. |
| `belay/minimal` | The Belay config and one skill. |

- Piton makes the directory if it is not there.
- Without a directory, it asks for the project name. An empty name or no
  terminal means the current directory.
- It asks for the name before the template.
- In an interactive run, it asks for the group, the template (lists that you
  can filter) and the adapters. The defaults of the template are checked. You
  must select one adapter or more. The checklist shows the platform and the
  target id.
- A group with one template does not ask. `--template belay` (only a group)
  asks for the template.
- A non-interactive run needs a full template name. Without `--adapter`, it
  keeps the defaults.
- `--list` lists groups and templates with descriptions, and does nothing
  more.
- `--adapter` can repeat or take commas. It works only for Belay templates.
  A Belay template is a template whose config lists adapters.
- The selected adapters change the import and the `adapters` list of the
  config (in the export order of `@piton/belay`, formatted).
- Piton writes `.adapters/<id>/` files only for selected adapters, for
  example the `opencode.json` of OpenCode.
- After it writes files, `init` tethers the declared `dependencies`. This
  needs the network. If tethering fails, the files stay, Piton tells you to
  run `piton tether`, and it exits with 1.
- `--no-tether` skips tethering. The next steps then include `piton tether`.
- Templates are in `create-templates/<group>/<name>`. A template directory
  holds exactly the files that a new project gets. `.template` files hold
  descriptions and Piton does not copy them. `.preferred` marks a group. To
  add a template, add a directory.
- Each template must check, format and build without errors for each
  adapter.
- `init` never overwrites a file. It names the conflicts and writes nothing.
- Esc or Ctrl+C cancels before Piton writes.
- Paths and tether output go to stdout. stderr shows the template, adapters,
  file count and next commands.
- Errors: an unknown template; a group or no template without a terminal; an
  unknown adapter; `--adapter` on a template that is not a Belay template;
  cancel; overwrite; tether failure.

**`agent`**:

- The default tool is `claude`.
- It starts the tool in the project root with a project primer and this
  prompt. The prompt is the `FLUENCY_PROMPT.md` of the project, or the copy
  in the binary.
- The primer gives the source root, the reference root and the instruction
  file:
  - If the project builds for the adapter of the tool, all three belong to
    that adapter.
  - In a shared project, the reference root belongs to the first adapter,
    unless Piton wrote the reference tree of the tool.
  - If the project does not build for the tool, all three belong to the
    first configured adapter.
- Piton adds the text to the instructions of the tool. It never replaces
  them:

| Tool | Method |
| --- | --- |
| `claude` | `--append-system-prompt` |
| `codex` | `-c developer_instructions=<TOML string>` |
| `opencode` | `--standalone`, with `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` that lists a temporary file (private server). Piton removes the file when OpenCode exits. |
| `muse` | `-c run.developer_prompt=<JSON string>` |

- Extra args go to the tool. For `muse exec` and `opencode run`, the options
  go after the subcommand.
- Subcommands that refuse the options (`muse resume`, `opencode models`) run
  without the prompt.
- If the tool is not on PATH, the result is an error. The error tells you to
  use `--print-fluency`.
- The exit status is the exit status of the tool.

## 16. Language server, editors, JavaScript

### 16.1 Features

`piton lsp` gives these features:

- Diagnostics for Piton and Belay. It does not report optional properties
  that are not there.
- Completion, hover, go to definition, type definition, document highlight,
  find references.
- Workspace rename, module rename, auto import, and import organization
  (unused, duplicate, not valid, too broad).
- Code actions: import a symbol, create an anchor, add an export, qualify a
  reference, resolve a simple inheritance conflict. Whole-file actions:
  organize imports, format.
- Document symbols and workspace symbols.
- Semantic highlights, inlay hints, format (full file only, minimal edits),
  folds, selection ranges.
- Hierarchy and provenance views, override lenses, a preview of compiled
  output.
- Source-to-output map. It shows in hover ("Compiled to") and in a code lens,
  never as document links.
- Detection of unused and redundant items.
- Detection of conflicts and of cycles. Cycle detection finds cycles that
  cannot resolve and anchors that extend themselves. It shows the cycle that
  caused the error. It does not report circular imports.
- Expression checks: a warning when an expression cannot give the required
  type.
- Export checks, links to related symbols (from an abstract to its
  implementations, from a base to its extensions), and inspection of
  resolved values.
- Documentation in hover, completion, symbols and hierarchy.
- An index of each source below the project root and of open files. If the
  entry is not there, the server reports it and loads all other files.
  Without an entry, it reports nothing as unused.
- No signature help.
- The server is not incremental. It compiles again after a pause of 250 ms in
  typing. A compile takes tens of milliseconds.

### 16.2 Protocol

- Positions use UTF-16. The server offers no other encoding.
- The server syncs the full buffer. Diagnostics and edits have versions. The
  server refuses old edits. It does not apply them incorrectly.
- Semantic tokens, inlay hints and lenses refresh after a save, a change on
  disk, a config change or a closed buffer. Typing does not cause a refresh,
  because the editor asks again for that buffer.
- Format, folds and selection read the buffer as it is. They never wait for
  a compile.

### 16.3 Feature rules

**Completion**:

- It uses the line rules of the parser. `-word` (a list item without its
  space) is a sentence.
- It never offers items that do not exist.
- It offers nothing in these places: an empty value (`property: `), after
  `.` in a string, comments, prose, escapes, quoted strings, a declared name,
  a keyword after `as`, a nested dictionary.
- **It offers each item one time.** It offers a name that a module exports
  again one time, imported from the shortest path. It offers each different
  anchor with the same name, and names its module.
- In a body, it offers the properties that are not there (required first).
  It does not offer properties that are there. It offers `pass` only in an
  empty body.
- A key that you complete before a colon that exists keeps one colon.
- It sends the insert range and the replace range. If you accept in the
  middle of a word, it replaces the full word.
- It adds documentation later, on request. Items older than the last compile
  get no documentation.

**Hover**:

- It shows only on symbols, declared names and `+` or `++`. It never shows
  on prose, literals, language keywords, comments, escaped text or names
  that do not resolve.
- It shows the type, the source (a link relative to the workspace),
  documentation, the inheritance chain, the export status and the compiled
  value.
- It tells if a property is inherited, is an override, or implements a
  required property. To implement a required property is not to override it.
- A required property says that you must write it.
- `this`, `self` and `super` tell what they mean.
- "Compiled to" shows only on the declared name.

**Go to definition**:

- A module path opens its file. A keyword goes to its anchor.
- `this` and `super` members go to the anchor that gives them. An override
  goes to the item that it replaces.
- The answer also tells which word the server followed, and gives the full
  target declaration.

**Type definition**: it goes to the constraint anchors in the written order.
An anchor goes to itself. Built-in types go nowhere.

**Document highlight**: it marks the declaration differently from reads.

**Rename**:

- Anchor names: `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Variable names and keys can also
  have `-`. Keywords are lowercase or kebab-case.
- Reserved words are not permitted.
- The server refuses collisions and bundled symbols, and gives a reason. It
  refuses a property name that the family already uses.
- An alias and its original are different names.
- To rename a module path, move its file. The server never changes the
  module path on an import line.

**Module rename** (move a file or folder):

- The server changes each `use` and `from` path that names it, before the
  move. It also changes the relative paths in the moved file.
- Each path keeps its style. Rooted paths stay rooted. Relative paths stay
  relative. `.pi` stays written or omitted. A path to the index of a folder
  stays a path to the folder.
- Package paths never change.

**Symbols**:

- Document symbols show constraints as written. Dictionary keys are nested
  below. List items are not symbols.
- Workspace symbols: case is not important. The order is exact match, prefix,
  substring, then subsequence. Shorter names come first. The maximum is 256.
  Bundled names are not included. Each symbol names its module relative to
  the workspace.

**Semantic tokens**:

- They cover only resolved names: anchor = class, property or key =
  property, variable, user keyword = keyword. A module path is a namespace.
- Names that do not resolve get no token. Prose gets no tokens. In a value,
  only expressions in `{...}` forms get tokens.
- The syntax highlighter shows all lexical items, with scopes that agree.

**Inlay hints**:

- The type hint shows the inferred type of an unconstrained value that is
  one `{}` expression, as `:: type`. It applies to properties and variables.
- The owner hint `← Owner` shows after a member that another anchor gives.
  It applies to members read through `this`, `super` or an anchor, only if
  the owner is not that anchor. `self` shows no hint.
- The server never hints literal types, overrides or composition operators.

**Code actions**:

- Each action relates to an item at the cursor: a name that does not
  resolve, a header line, or an import. Plain text gets no actions.
- Whole-file actions show when the editor asks for that kind. Organize
  imports also shows when the cursor is on an import.

**Format**: the server does not format part of a file, because that can
change the structure.

**Overrides**: an implementation of a required property gets no lens. The
lens opens the declaration that the override replaces. "Find
implementations" lists the anchors that write the property themselves.

**Selection ranges**: they grow from a name through each expression around
it, the braces, the value, the property, each block around it, the
declaration and the file. Each step is wider than the last. No step includes
blank lines around it.

**Folds**: declarations, block properties, escape blocks (with their fence),
and groups of 2 or more comment lines or import lines. A fold covers full
lines from the first to the last content line. A header that is not complete
still folds.

### 16.4 Editors

Editors must:

- Indent one level after Enter on a colon that opens a block.
- Remove one level of indent after Enter on a blank line in a block.
- Optionally format on save. This adds the space after `//` and changes
  nothing more in comments.

Highlighters must:

- Show prose in the plain text style. Imports and declarations are only at
  column 0. An indented line such as `use the spec to decide` is prose.
- Show `$`, `#`, `@`, backticks and brackets without a pair in prose as part
  of the string.
- Show a value that is exactly a number, boolean or null as that type. With
  other text next to it, it is prose.
- Show a quoted string in `{...}` as a string.
- Show code fences as usual Piton. Show escape blocks as verbatim text. They
  can optionally use the highlight of the fence language.
- Agree with the classification of the parser. Tests check this
  (`editors/fixtures/`). A syntax definition can differ from the parser only
  where a known, listed gap tells why.

| Editor | Highlighter | LSP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VS Code | TextMate | Full |
| Emacs, Helix, Zed | tree-sitter | Full |
| Neovim, Vim | vim syntax | Full |
| JetBrains | `jetbrains` | Full |
| Sublime | `sublime-syntax` | Full |
| Kate | `KSyntaxHighlighting` | Full |

The editor files are below `editors/`.

### 16.5 JavaScript

- `packages/vite-plugin-piton` imports `.pi` files as modules. It supports
  HMR, dependency tracking (through `compile --dependencies`) and virtual
  modules.
- Each export is a named export. The default export is the full file, the
  same as the output of `piton compile`.
- You can configure the default renderer (`'json' | 'yaml' | 'markdown'`).
  You can also import the renderers as functions from
  `vite-plugin-piton/renderers`.
- `packages/astro-piton` wraps the plugin for Astro.

```ts
import { SaveButton, pi } from '../spec/app.pi';
import spec from '../spec/app.pi';
```

`spec.CancelButton` reads one export from the default export.

## 17. The agent tools of this repository (`spec/agent/`)

`spec/agent/index.pi` exports these items. Belay compiles them for the agent.

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `skill GenerateFluencyPrompt` | Makes this prompt from the full spec and writes it to `${FLUENCY_PROMPT_FILE}` (`${BELAY_PROJECT_ROOT}/FLUENCY_PROMPT.md`). The prompt must be small but complete, in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. |
| `skill BuildTooling` | Reads the spec in `.claude/reference` and builds the tools. The stack is Rust, chumsky, rowan and tower-lsp. |
| `skill InspectSpec` | Reads `spec/` and answers questions. Without more instructions, it summarizes the language and reports spec problems. It saves reports as standalone HTML in the current directory. Each problem names the files that cause it. |
| `command CheckSpecForProblems` | Reads `${BELAY_PROJECT_ROOT}/spec`. It finds parts that are underdefined, overdefined, contradictory or badly organized. It shows the problems one at a time. The user selects the source of truth or adds a clarification. |

`xtask` commands (from BuildTooling):

- `xtask install` builds the release and installs it on the local machine.
- `xtask sync-fluency` makes `FLUENCY_PROMPT.md` again. Then it copies it over
  `crates/piton-cli/src/fluency.md`. That is the copy in the binary that
  `piton agent` uses if the project has no prompt. Then it tells you to build
  again.
  - It runs `claude -p` headless with the GenerateFluencyPrompt skill in the
    repository root. Claude can read, search and write, and Piton accepts its
    edits. Claude cannot run commands. `--model` selects the model.
  - If Claude fails, is not on PATH, or ends without a non-empty file, the
    result is an error. Piton copies nothing.
  - If the prompt did not change, Piton tells you, and it still copies it.
  - `--copy-only` does not make the prompt. It only copies.
  - `--check` makes the prompt and copies nothing. It fails when the two
    copies are different and names the command that fixes it. Use it in CI.

The spec also holds tests (`spec/tests/`). Examples:

- `CommandsArePrefixed`: commands start with `x-`. On Claude Code they are
  skills with `disable-model-invocation: true`.
- `SkillDescriptionJoinsUseWhen`: the skill description is the description,
  then "Use when", then `useWhen`.

## 18. Work on a specbase

1. **Learn the project.**
   - Read `piton.config.pi`: root, entry, output, frameworks, adapters,
     codeRoot, shapeRoot, plugins.
   - Read the entry, usually `spec/index.pi`. In this repository it exports
     `Specification` (FoundingThesis, Language, Tooling, Belay,
     PackageManagement, Plugins, Testing) and the items of `spec/agent/`.
   - Read down through the `index.pi` files.
   - Compiled reference files give an overview. The source is the truth.
   - `piton slice` gives a focused view of one item.
2. **Edit the `.pi` source.** Obey the local conventions:
   - One exported anchor in each file, with the file name of the anchor.
   - Index files use `from ./X export *`.
   - Export abstracts with a keyword. Put shared abstracts in `lib/`.
   - Property names are lowerCamelCase. Exported constant lists are
     SCREAMING_CASE.
   - Put prose in string blocks. Put structure in keys and lists.
   - Use `@{X}` for links.
   - Wrap fenced examples in `\\\`.
3. **Write the imports.**
   - Use `use` for keywords and `import` for names. Frequently you need both.
   - A new file compiles only if the entry reaches it. Tests are different:
     Piton finds them below the full source root.
4. **Validate.**
   - Run `piton check`.
   - Compile each spec example that you edited with `piton compile`. Compare
     it with its ` ```json ` block. Piton does not check escape blocks.
     Remember that only exports show.
   - Run `piton build` and read the diff of the generated files.
   - Run `piton reach` and `piton format --check`.
   - Run `piton test` if the project has tests.
5. **Do not edit generated files.** These are:
   - `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` below `codeRoot`.
   - `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`, `.opencode/`, `.muse/`.
   - Build output that `.piton/manifest.json` lists, and `.piton/` itself.
6. **The spec and the implementation must agree.** If they do not agree,
   report it. Do not change the spec to fit the code. Use `piton compile` to
   see the current behaviour.

## 19. Compiler and spec

The spec does not name these items. The compiler has them:

- Most diagnostic codes in this document. The spec says only "error" or
  "warning". The codes are the names that the compiler uses.
  `duplicate-export` and `unsupported-construct` are in the spec.
- The CLI flags `build --dry-run`, `reach --no-unreachable`,
  `reach --no-paths`, and `format -`.
- `check` with a directory as a path. Without a config, `check` checks all
  `.pi` files below the current directory.
- The list of constructs that need a `description` for each adapter. It is in
  `crates/piton-belay/src/adapter.rs`, not in the adapter `.pi` files.
- The `remove` rules (refuse if edited or imported) and the `dangling-pin`
  and `unknown-pin` codes.

Differences and limits:

- A paragraph break compiles to one `\n`. Markdown shows this as a soft break
  in one paragraph. The spec shows two paragraphs.
- The compiler splits digits in headings: `t1` → `T 1`.
- An import with a `/` root in an installed package resolves against the
  root of the consumer. Use relative imports in packages.
- A value from a concrete base does not satisfy a required abstract
  property. The abstract of the keyword comes last, and its declaration
  without a value wins. Set the property on the anchor itself.
- `piton check` without paths checks only what the entry reaches. Name the
  files that it does not reach.
- **Prose directly in an anchor body (with no key) disappears without an
  error.** Put it below a key such as `description:`.
- `==` on two different types gives false (`{1 == "1"}`). It is not an error.
- `spec/scope/tooling/index.pi` holds a placeholder property
  `something: HAHA TOOLING`. Report it if your work touches that file.
